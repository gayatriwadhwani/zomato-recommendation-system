Bengaluru in India being one such city has more than 12,000 restaurants with restaurants serving dishes from all over the world. With each day new restaurants opening the industry hasn't been saturated yet and the demand is increasing day by day. In spite of increasing demand, it however has become difficult for new restaurants to compete with established restaurants. Most of them serving the same food. Bengaluru is the IT capital of India. Most of the people here are dependent mainly on the restaurant food as they donâ€™t have time to cook for themselves. With such an overwhelming demand for restaurants, it has therefore become important to study the demography of a location. We will use data set from Zomatao containing data of Banglore city.

The aim is to create a content-based recommender system in which when we will write a restaurant name, the Recommender system will look at the reviews of other restaurants, and the System will recommend us other restaurants with similar reviews and sort them from the highest-rated.
